# War of Dice

A 2 player game where each player "rolls" a die by pressing a button. High score wins the round.

Parts I used:
 * [Feather 32u4 AdaLogger](https://www.adafruit.com/products/2795)
 * [NeoPixel FeatherWing](https://www.adafruit.com/products/2945)
 * [Tactile Buttons](https://www.adafruit.com/products/367)

See the [Fritzing](./war-of-dice.fzz) for setup.

There is a [demo video on my blog](https://nickmomrik.com/2016/12/22/i-created-a-game/).
